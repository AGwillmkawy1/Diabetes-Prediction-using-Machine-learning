# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-learning
Diabetes prediction using machine learning involves using data and machine learning algorithms to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes or not. It is a task of binary classification, where the goal is to determine if a person belongs to the "diabetic" or "non-diabetic" class based on a set of input features.
